- 👋 Hi, I’m Sebastiano Rizzi
- 👀 I’m interested in creative things design, photography, videography, painting, fashion, cooking, and that is what got me into coding, more specifically wanting to become a web developer!
- 💻 I’m currently finishing my Java certificationa and working on some personal projects which will be added in my portfolio.
- 📧 How to reach me by email at sebastianorizzi99@icloud.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am Italian and moved to the USA 7 years ago. I have lived in Austin, TX and Miami, FL and now I am in Austin again. Since then I have been working in my family real estate business. We have a Brokerage and Property Management business in both cities, but I love coding and am hoping to turn this into my full time job eventually.

I am always down to meet new people and have a chat! I can do lots of things and am an absolute coffee addict as well as passionate for cooking.. so if you want to chat about life or coffee or italian food I am always happy to make new friends! 👍🏻
